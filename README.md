Hi my names James but I've always gone by Jim, something fun about me is I lived in Turkey for a while and I built 20+ websites by the time I was a sophomore in high school.
## I believe in inspiring anyone from any industry to pursue Computer Science, and not be discouraged by its perceived complexity.

Other things I had worked on:
dajwebs.com: a community i made for friends and e-mailed homework to myself

mxodreamwarriors.com: a Matrix Online community as shown in screenshot above built with HTML at the time and some forums, edited a clantemplates.com template and character renders that would load on page load and render in

NBK was a Call of duty 1 and United Offensive modding community I was also a part of that led me to some of my first roles, I would edit animations in signatures in .swf
I used PHP-Nuke and edited plugins for: soulsofthefire.com a Guild Wars 2 community.  I was indeed also a member of KSI, and several other eSports teams... including [my own](https://www.challengermode.com/teams/e5db006c-5a5a-e811-80c3-000d3a2234e3) where i competed and have launching some new things in Discord below...

and used Enjin CMS before it was deprecated for: checkered-raven.com it was a Neverwinter guild
