Hello, my name's James but I've always gone by Jim.<br>
I built over 20+ websites by the time I was a sophomore in high school.

## I believe in inspiring anyone from any industry to pursue Computer Science, and not be discouraged by its perceived complexity. 
<br>

# [Here is a great video on that I highly encourage you share.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc)

### Thank you for stopping by.

Here are also my [writings](https://jimsuley.substack.com/p/notes-on-computers) on computer architecture.
