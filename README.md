I'm leaving this as tame as possible, however:

It's a bit of my own bouncing board, cheerio!

Anyways, welcome to my readme.
This is my Readme file on:
GitHub (duh).

On Wednesdays we wear pink, haha, I understood the reference, 

So then I was writing a new line,
New Line:
My GitHub includes all of my backed up homework and then some, it'll be down there in the pins section, there are lots of cool readme possibilities, kind of like the old MySpace days when you think about it, 

"It's cool, it's just like a reflection of their personalities." - My High School Basketball Coach.

...I made my own e-mail and I e-mailed all my high school homework to myself, as much as I could or remembered to.

//in case you were unawares, usually two forward slashes leaves a comment :) 

Now time to sound conceited:
So you think you are able to write a signature? LUL

Well, I animated one with Swish Max 2, with the help of some U.K. gamer friends :), 
Cracked adobe photoshop cs2 before it was free, 
php-nuke was more aesthetically interesting as a Content Management System (IMHO), 
(I better preferred three-column layouts, the whole infinite scroll is too addicting in my honest opinion,
I greatly dislike the current state of frontend development at this current conjecture in our history, I feel it is gate-keeped and I don't like it.

In my humble opinion, these are technologies that should be open-sourced, not companies, people don't deserve that much of Machiavellian power based on the efforts of others, once again, just in my own opinon.

I also liked Notepad++ on Windows XP, and I learned to Code cash registers in Visual Basic in high school (watch out for those darn CD-ROM drives, I guess it makes a nice cup holder)?

Funny jokes to use while gaming, but a little facetious to watch out for: Alt-f4 is funny though (You know what Italy is shaped like?  A boot)  Funny joke I think.

Another joke to end the readme with I just thought of, another fun acronym one of my best friends in high school made up: BBQROFLWTFCOPTER, look it up, 
and one more joke:

The world just keeps going 'round and 'round, but some things are taller than others. 

Also, learned jgrasp, and taught myself how to use FileZilla and web design myself, buh bye!
