github readme


How bout a draw my life, but in text form?   

Most of this probably shouldn't waste your time reading, but if you want here you go!     


Let's call some libraries, 


library Earth Sol System

library Known Physics library circa 2023 with general relativity + WMF + SMF + and Quantum Mechanics, you know, all that jazz.   


let's instantiate some variables

string, integer, no

let's just make an object called prefaceToday, or prologueToday...   
also it looks like Github is not catching my spelling mistakes all with red lines while typing this up, will fix later.

I'd like to preface that my life isn't really that cool, there's millions of military brats like me, it's mostly boring, and uneventful, and I feel I'm mostly just kind of just on an interesting ride?  I guess I coulda worked harder in school, been less lazy.    

So, I was born '91 on an Airfoce Base, 
Dad was a Captain, retired in '94, previously enlisted Navy and about 20 years served.  

We moved to North Carolina after a bit of a tumultuous civilian transition, he got a job at Nortel Networks as like a Quality guy. 

Lived in the RTP area... ages 6-12. 

While there, it was cool, played Xbox Live... that was fun, had a Compaq, MS-Dos games like cheesy invaders, Igor's Adventure, there was a cool roman platformer if you find it let me know!, and something like a predecessor to divinity I don't quite remember, then on the Compaq played Tomb Raider II man that was a good one.   Magic Carpet 1 & 2, multiplayer as well.  

On the Compaq we also networked with the Alienware for 1v1 battles with the bro in unreal tournament, played online and created D&D like worlds, I made a really good custom map in Vampire the Masquerade: Redemption.  My online handle there was Saburotsu, we stacked for 1v1 duels, you can max out your gear and glide around the lobby and 1v1 people with swords and shit.  I also made a custom map called "The Lost Cause Bar."  If you remember this mod you'd walk in and there'd be an NPC looking down that looked like scorpion with a crossbow, pretty funny, and then a dead guy in the corner.  I modded that shit in at like age 9-11?  Bar was stocked too, lotta red wine, pretty dope.  

So then United Offensive mod came out that was really fun, Anti-Gravity mods, sniper mods, macros, learned a lot, was fun(would blast 50 cent's album and Prodigy a lot) clan battles, cool communities (shoutout to the english speakers in GMT+2 where we'd hang out and do cool shit).  I was HeadSh(+)t there.  Oh and wanna come back and toss this in here on my HP later where most of my web design happened, Half-Life 2 was also amazing, lul the old Steam green layout.  
Not too sound conceited here.  Oh I also made some custom Xfire skins, Cool Abstract Art, etc.

Played that after 9/11 and we moved from 5th grade to 7th grade to Incirlik.  

Fuckn sucked.  

Aced every assignment, held back after 1st or 2nd quarter with I'll call her by a different first name Alice.  Alice and I got held back one day after class, teacher asked do you two want to skip grades? (Mind you this is after my dad didn't let me skip 2nd grade). 

She said no I said yes.  She skipped I didn't, Dad again.  

So then, yeah fuck grades dawg.  8th grade and 9th grade was ok.  10th grade honor roll anyway... 11th grade every activity known to man, and then other shit and stuff before graduating from a small DoDDS-E school, again millions of kids around the world, amazing community, I got a great education on a block schedule and stuff.  Feel blessed in that regard.  

Meanwhile my stack included: 

SwishMax, created a lot of flash images in .swf
before Adobe Flash and Dreamweaver were cool? 

Then uhm what else, quite a bit... 

Adobe Photoshop CS2

FTP servers to multiple sites I created between ages 11-15 included on an HP computer:
//
www.mxodreamwarriors.com (matrix online community)
//
www.soulsofthefire.com (guild wars 1 guild) 
//
www.dajwebs.com, personal site dished out emails to the bois
//
www.thejweb.com
//
www.checkeredraven.com (Neverwinter community)
//
www.uhm there's like at least 4-5 more I forgot

So, yeah my Dad told me this was a waste of time I guess?  Indoors all day making websites, I thought it was cool, 

But I guess I was expecting to enlist in the Air Force anyway, I wanted to serve.  

You can get by on Cs after Senior year or on Senior year probably... my goal was to enlist work hard and then become an officer probably.  What did it matter if I was in AP US History, AP English, whatever the fuck. 
Calculus, Trig, Physics were very fun though, I don't think I want to name the teachers but there were a couple I still think about how will they conveyed information and I think I retained all of it. 

Then, after a very fun junior year, senior year sucked.  I couldn't join because my medical waiver was denied fuck me.  I had to watch others swear in that was fun.  I would have happily served in any branch, leaning toward Army enlist, Army officer, or Navy, Marines, anything!  But I couldn't medical waiver is disqualification from any branch.  

Oh well, I tried to not let it get to me, think it didn't have an impact on my life and keep workin toward something else, but it probably did.  

Was often told though, "There's other ways you can serve." 

Think me wanting to wear the uniform, probably would have been selfish (feel free to unpack that later if you want and got this far).  

Ok so the rest of my tech stack on GitHub, 

Bit of a few years gap here.  Demotivated to computer science, I had in the back of mind I thought it was cliche'
too easy. In hindsight not at all and very stupid thought really.

Leant toward electrical engineering, hardware engineering, renewable energies, I guess not really sure.  

Remember in '07-09 in home room, researching Deep Mind. 

Later in 2013-14 papers on machine learning... less roles then.  

Physics teacher was awesome, she brought up Bitcoin and decentralization, sitting in front of my dell computer I thought that was cool, this was 3 years after I did a netsend * hello everyone and someone else hit enter in the library around the same time I built a Saints Row 2 multiplayer phpbb forum, got sent to the principal's office

was already netsending friends 1:1, and then next day as teachers logged in

pop-up: Hello Everyone

lmao

So anyway.  I loved basketball i played the 2 spot off the bench and got most improved player. 

Swung off the rim once after jumping on it from the bleachers during a pep rally, probably shouldn't have?  Was fun tho, glad didn't turn out badly, I think I was fully aware while drawn in the bleachers had good support for the rim and backboard though, connected some iPhones together and played Stevie Wonder and The Beatles, good playlist...

Oh back to the gap in stack, 

So lot has happened since 2012-2016, huh?

Damn that's a lot of frontend frameworks, 
React, Rust, Laravel, idk what the fuck?  

So many CMS' Drupal Joomla, I liked php-nuke what is the successor to that my guys? 

So, I think it's all convoluted, design stuff is cool on the frontend and sharing all that shit on twitter is cool but no one really cares IRL when I talk about it, or maybe they do?  I just think that in my head (I do want to learn Rust, Typescript, and will attempt to focus and get better at something, I want to become a subject matter expert and pursue life long learning), trying not to be a buzz-killington I do really enjoy it.  I do probably want to pivot to a frontend engineer, iOS engineer, SWE somewhere idk. IP law? Deeper into Computer Science? Or maybe entrepreneurship etc.

Making it easy and simple (KISS!) Jack Mallers' say that, that's the hard thing to do. 

Oh another thing I was originally gonna end with, 

throughout my life so many people have impressed me and I learned from, often a theme I find: 

underpromise and over-deliver, 

even more, don't say anything and over-deliver spectacularly, inspiringly, 

Give people what they need, maybe that's what makes you a legend? 

How bout we build cool shit now everyone, for the world, to help people.  



I left out some shit, whatever.  Sorry for cussing.


 

Oh here's an interaction when I interviewed for a 4-5th job I had on the base?  

I had a model guy after a year or two after high school, he was enlisted who became an officer, 2nd lieutenant after working his way as enlisted, 2nd lieutenant - still doing well in enlisted housing.  Helped him spoof his Mac and set up a VPN even though he was in cybersecurity and got his Facebook hacked creating spam and helped him do that to get around a region block to get an update on Xbox since i don't think he knew how or had time to figure that out, helpeda coworker on that at the Base Exchange too...

Anyway this was my interviewer, this wasn't the same guy, 

There was a decrepitness to his voice, 

Who are these IT professionals on a remote base who are applying for an entry-level job with fat resumes that are going to do the job better than me, longer than me?  They don't exist, spouses (they should and do get spousal preference)?  Few and far between I don't know what they're up to but we're talking a pool of literally less than probably 10 candidates.  3?  2?   I only saw I think 2-7 resumes, I doubt if the papers under that cluttered office room we're related, it was pretty cluttered and there's lots of random boxes I don't remember on the left and right of the desk and on the left and right on top of the desk and the small little stack on the left of the desk.      

Who did he hire?  Anyone?  I don't know, that person even worked there longer than less than a year?  Doubt it!  I saw in his eyes as he said they have a lack of resources that he didn't want to be there.  He didn't want to fix it, he wanted to go home.  "We have a lack of resources."  "Often you have to do this job with less that you have access to..." yada-yada.  Then back to that three-page resume.  Oh I need more experience?  OK, I get it. I get it.  This is not the right reaction.  But I think it is.  Maybe when JFK called that general on expenditure of the hospital couch, he was right!  

But I need more experience.  Ok so I do.  I already was ~2 years out of college pretty much, where am I gonna work?  What resources, I already had a great computer science background and some education I think, and drafted a pretty good candidate resume, I could have done it I could have learned and ironically I lived there.  Woulda learned the system like the back of my hand and they would have gotten a good 2-15 years out of me if they wanted!  At least!  But I digress, how bout not just hire anyone or someone and leave, that's cool too.  We need more liaisons who are there long-term, invested in the area, cultural liaisons, people familiar with the area.  Or just entirely go then.  
I want to edit here that I can convey this more eloquently and take more time on it but that's just what's rattling up in this military brat's kid head.  And there are already amazing people maybe a handful, nationals who work for the base in a capacity from engineering to operations (like my mom did), and that they fill that niche/role a bit I describe, but we need more, maybe another department of the Force Support Squadrons etc. Would be great, I often think of that Colonel who built a good relationship with an Afghan general guy who were friends, he left.  The American colonel then calls the Afghan guy from his suburban back yard after he went home, didn't sit right with me that scene he's gone but OK still friends, Afghan friend dies in helicopter few weeks later...   I forget the name of this documentary.
Maybe in the future I can write more about or help spur some changes, I don't know.  Life's weird. Don't know what may happen.  I hope the best for everyone, and our developing world.



Peace out y'all I might edit this late or something

I also really enjoyed my OOD and HTML/CSS classes in person, I think it's important to get a fundamental understanding of everything, ground-up like history of machines fetch-decode-execute cycle, math, first computers on to current systems.  I think knowing full well how it all meshes together, means that you are better prepared to tackle a problem as a team and solve something, because you know the ins-and-outs and are confident, we should all be like that. 

More reading in that regard: 

My stuffs: https://linktr.ee/jimSuley

I'll add in what my old websites were like later 
(I did have an awesome render of Matrix Online characters in an HTML page where when you loaded the other page it did a javscript animation like the mutliple blocks coming together, now in hindsight I think that was a .swf embed too)

probably gonna edit this entire thing later and clean it up, take out the swear words, enjoy it while it lasts

Oh also, while in Turkey, Attack of the Show was awesome, LAN parties at the community center with friends, and watching that with KP and Olivia Munn, she was a military brat too!  
Lots of Halo 2, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, and Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

Lots of touching grass with friends, good times.
