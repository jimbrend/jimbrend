Hi ntmu, I'm Jim, I'm fluent in turkish but a native English speaker and US Citizen born in CA, four short years later I moved to NC...<br>
I spent an aggregate 12 years overseas so far and built over 20+ websites by the time I was a sophomore in high school.
You may know me as usernameisjim from the lightning network communities, or other companies such as Apple where I began WFH then worked at one of their corporate offices so far...
I'm currently open to new offers, and am working on grad studies and looking forward to new projects here or anything relevant I'm able to share publicly here.

## I believe in inspiring anyone from any industry to pursue Computer Science, and not be discouraged by its perceived complexity. 
<br>

### Thank you for stopping by.
