So you think you are able to write a signature, well I animated one with wish max2, cracked adobe photoshop cs2 before it was free, php-nuke is indeed a better CMS (I better preferred three-column layouts, the whole infinite scroll is too addicting, I greatly dislike the current state of frontend development it's gate-keeped and I don't like it these are technologies that should be open-sourced, not companies, people don't deserve that much of Machiavellin power based on the efforts of others. 
I also liked notepad++ on Windows XP, Learning to Code cash registers in Visual Basic (watch out for those darn CD-ROM drives, I guess it makes a nice cup holder?.. Alt-f4 is funny though (You know what Italy is shaped like?  A boot)  Funny joke I think. Also, learned jgrasp, and taught myself how to use FileZilla and web design myself, buh bye!
