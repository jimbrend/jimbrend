Hi my names James but I've always gone by Jim, something fun about me is I lived in Turkey for a while and I built 20+ websites by the time I was a sophomore in high school.
## I believe in inspiring anyone from any industry to pursue Computer Science, and not be discouraged by its perceived complexity.
