Hi my names James but I've always gone by Jim, something fun about me is I lived in Turkey for a while and I built 20+ websites by the time I was a sophomore in high school.
## I believe in inspiring anyone from any industry to pursue Computer Science, and not be discouraged by its perceived complexity.

### Thank you for stopping by.

//Here are also my [writings](https://jimsuley.substack.com/p/notes-on-computers) on computer architecture.

Here are some more things I had worked on:

One of the first websites I made was dajwebs.com, a community i made for friends and e-mailed homework to myself it used several scripting languages and phpbb forums.

Me superjumping (in the emulator of a previously released and inactive MxO title as detailed more below): https://www.twitch.tv/usernameisjim/clip/PopularTangibleWatermelonANELE-Em9lLEeK0FM98-ki)

mxodreamwarriors.com: a Matrix Online community (from  the PC game The Matrix Online as shown in screenshot above) built with HTML at the time and some forums, edited a clantemplates.com template and character renders that would load in on page load and render in with different animations which was cool.

NBK was a Call of duty 1 and United Offensive modding community I was also a part of that led me to some of my first roles, I would edit animations in signatures in .swf
I used PHP-Nuke and edited plugins for: soulsofthefire.com a Guild Wars 1 community.  I was indeed also a member of KSI, and several other eSports teams... including [my own](https://www.challengermode.com/teams/e5db006c-5a5a-e811-80c3-000d3a2234e3) where I [competed](https://tr.ee/t1rZn1RB7T) and launching some new things in Discord below...

and used Enjin CMS before it was deprecated for: checkered-raven.com it was a Neverwinter guild

the most recent was scraped with a robots.txt and you can find it on the waybackmachine you can see some had 1,000 visits in a day like with server firsts in Neverwinter...

as well as easterncustoms.com, a MD computer business 

I've had several affiliations with e-mails currently not active like my name @ rockstargames.com, @ubisoft.com, @apple.com, @strike.me, @umbrel.com, @swan.com, @credible.com, @charter.com
if you want to e-mail me on those or have past interactions, don't have access to those now.

My best e-mail if you would like to send me one is jim@sunbirdcomputer.com right now for business inquiries for my own content creation like twitch streamers share or side projects, I usually communicate with other businesses or for offers on personal details not shared here currently or directly with active work e-mail...
