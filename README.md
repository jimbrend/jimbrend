<details><summary>About Me</summary>

The clip above is from the emulator that still exists here: https://mxoemu.info/ from The Matrix Online, there is a community on Discord for it, as you can see you are still able to load it up and I got superjumping going thanks as well to the contributions of those supporting the emulator.

During this time I made a community website of the many websites I made myself one was called dajwebs.com, it was a social website just for friends and games. I built websites for several gaming communities and contributed to designs to several marketplaces like themeforest, and built mxodreamwarriors.com (A Matrix Online MMO) group, I also played City of Heroes, Villains, and Guild Wars 1 etc. I had custom rendered characters that animated upon each page load in, was pretty cool, I helped set this up I remember was very fun (Unfortunately I guess Sony Online Entertainment dropped the ball or priorities changed I don't know but if anyone knows of a project like this upcoming please let me know I'm interested):

Some music I enjoy (the preview below is randomly cycling album artwork when you refresh this page):

I've created well over 30+ websites in my lifetime: 
soulsofthefire.com (at one point averaged 1000+ visits a day)
checkeredraven.com (communities for guild wars and neverwinter)
A Saints Row 2 Website for the multiplayer mode run on a community forum utilizing php-bb
www.dajwebs.com and www.thejweb.com were once owned by me as well, jimsbr.com may go live later
the former were based on HTML and I developed them as PHP and HTML websites for friends.
I also utilized several different CMS software, Apache, mySQL, Javascript, and much more usually self-hosting and building them all and either self-hosting them on my own machine or utilizing a friends web-hosting service who lives in the U.K.
There are several more I have worked on... Developers, Developers, Developers! lol 

Anyway,

I met very cool people while playing games I always enjoyed spending time with diverse groups of people, and I went on to work for RockstarGames and Ubisoft in my career before moving on to some other projects outside of gaming (though I still work on things like Overwatch 2 support on Mac in my spare time and am open to any projects like this)...

https://www.easterncustoms.com this was a soft opening with some on-demand store tech at the time, it exists on the waybackmachine but is dissolved.
https://www.20XFive.com was the second LLC / sole proprietorship I paid for and is also now deprecated

The thought process behind it was century-long thinking such as in the Eastern Hemisphere there has been a better focus on low-time preference thinking I feel sometimes, whereas in the West-- it almost seems like maybe culturally we just tend to focus on one thing at once, just culture and communication. 

I have several projects currently I'm dabbling with and own a few domains for now:
https://www.bitcoincookie.com
https://www.sunbirdcomputers.com
https://www.sunbirdcomputer.com
https://www.gamingcomputer.bitcoin (this one does not resolve for most browsers yet it uses [unstoppable domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/))
Depending on my workload sunbirdcomputer may become operational and propagate through cyberspace
I am a staunch advocate of using [BTCPayServer.org](https://btcpayserver.org/) as an open-source technology to empower individuals

My GitHub includes as well a lot of my backed up homework and then some, I made my own e-mail and I e-mailed all my high school homework to myself, as much as I could or remembered to. 

There are lots of cool readme possibilities, kind of like the old MySpace days when you think about it, 

"It's cool, it's just like a reflection of their personalities." - My High School Basketball Coach.



//In case you were unawares and stumbled upon my readme as a non-dev, learning computer science I highly recommend!  Usually two forward slashes means this is a comment too at the beginning of this line :) 

Now time to sound conceited?
I animated my websites since Swish Max 2, 
Cracked adobe photoshop cs2 before it was free (with the help of some U.K. gamer friends :), 
php-nuke was more aesthetically interesting as a Content Management System in my honest opinion, 
(I better preferred three-column layouts, the whole infinite scroll is too addicting in my honest opinion,
I am apprehensive about the current state of frontend development at this current conjecture in our history, I feel it is too gate-keeped).

In my humble opinion, these are technologies that should be open-sourced, dependent on the product.  I believe this was touched on during a great discussion with Lex Fridman and Pieter Levels and I think I agreed greatly with Pieter on that sentiment:

I also liked Notepad++ on Windows XP, and I learned to Code cash registers in Visual Basic in high school, I always tried to focus, but watch out for those darn CD-ROM drives, 
I guess they make a nice cup holder? :P
