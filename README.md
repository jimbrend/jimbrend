I'm leaving this as tame as possible, 

Y'all like green bubbles right? 

Well I got some  Ô∏è‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•    *heart of fire*  bars.

During this time I made a community website of the many websites I made myself one was called dajwebs.com, where I e-mailed all my homework to myself, it was going to be a social website just for friends and games.  Specifically was a Halo HTML website, and mxodreamwarriors.com (A Matrix Online MMO) clan, I also played City of Heroes, Villains, and Guild Wars 1 etc. I had custom rendered characters that animated upon each page load in, was pretty cool, I helped set this up I remember was very fun (Unfortunately I guess Sony Online Entertainment dropped the ball or priorities changed I don't know but if anyone knows of a project like this upcoming please let me know I'm interested):

Websites I've had created in my lifetime: 

www.soulsofthefire.com
(A community for Guild Wars 1)

A Saints Row 2 Website for the multiplayer mode run on a community forum utilizing php-bb

www.dajwebs.com and www.thejweb.com and www.jimsbr.com were once owned by me as well, 
the former were based on HTML and I developed them as a PHP and HTML website for friends.
Developers, Developers, Developers! lol 

Anyway,

Also, there was https://www.mxodreamwarriors.com for the video game The Matrix Online, 
That game was so fun I guess there was some cost issue with the publisher, I don't know what happened there, but I liked the game.
The emulator still exists there is a community on Discord for it, I met very cool people while playing games I always enjoyed spending times with diverse groups of people.

https://www.easterncustoms.com this was a soft opening with some on-demand store tech at the time, but is defunkt.
https://www.20XFive.com was the second LLC / sole proprietorship I paid for and is also now deprecated
The thought process behind it was century-long thinking such as in the Eastern Hemisphere there has been a better focus on low-time preference thinking I feel sometimes, whereas in the West-- it almost seems like maybe culturally we just tend to focus on one thing at once, just culture and communication. 

www.bitcoincookie.com
www.sunbirdcomputers.com
Are also currently operational and online propagating through the cyberspace as we drive ICE cars around sometimes instead of just walking, and feel free to call the brokerage or don't just ask me in an X direct message my personal is x.com/usernameisjim I will only entertain legitimate offers at this time for investment or interest. 

https://www.sunbirdcomputers.com actually has a live chat as well you just click it and are able to type your words right there, I just try to make websites and computers- the real geniuses are working on electric cars and spaceships.


These are some songs I enjoy:

Here's some more wall o' text in my readme, thanks!

It's a bit of my own bouncing board, cheerio!

think face/wut face emoji here LUL

Anyways, welcome to my readme.
This is my Readme file on:
GitHub (duh).

On Wednesdays we wear pink, haha, I understood the reference, 

So then I was writing a new line,
New Line:
My GitHub includes all of my backed up homework and then some, it'll be down there in the pins section, there are lots of cool readme possibilities, kind of like the old MySpace days when you think about it, 

"It's cool, it's just like a reflection of their personalities." - My High School Basketball Coach.

...I made my own e-mail and I e-mailed all my high school homework to myself, as much as I could or remembered to.

//in case you were unawares, usually two forward slashes leaves a comment :) 

Now time to sound conceited:
So you think you are able to write a signature? LUL

Well, I animated one with Swish Max 2, with the help of some U.K. gamer friends :), 
Cracked adobe photoshop cs2 before it was free, 
php-nuke was more aesthetically interesting as a Content Management System (IMHO), 
(I better preferred three-column layouts, the whole infinite scroll is too addicting in my honest opinion,
I greatly dislike the current state of frontend development at this current conjecture in our history, I feel it is gate-keeped and I don't like it).

In my humble opinion, these are technologies that should be open-sourced, not companies, people don't deserve that much of Machiavellian power based on the efforts of others, once again, just in my own opinon.

I also liked Notepad++ on Windows XP, and I learned to Code cash registers in Visual Basic in high school, because I had a good teacher, who simply gave me one textbook, I did the rest, and I always tried to focus, but watch out for those darn CD-ROM drives, I guess they make a nice cup holder, lol)?

Funny jokes to use while gaming, but a little facetious to watch out for: Alt-f4 is funny though (You know what Italy is shaped like?  A boot)  Funny joke I think.

Another joke to end the readme with I just thought of, another fun acronym one of my best friends in high school made up (he studies for many years to become a clinical pharmacist): BBQROFLWTFCOPTER,
The reference reminds me of Family Guy's Rock Lobster meets sort of a Beam Rifle in Halo 2 (We were probably playing Halo 2 at the time) it's kind of a reference.

One more joke:

The world just keeps going 'round and 'round, but some things rise to the canopy of the Amazonian ecosystem.

Also, learned jgrasp, and taught myself how to use FileZilla and attempted to understand responsive web design myself (the textbook mentioned above was also Algebra had two great math teachers), buh bye!
